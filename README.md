# Neuromechanics Lab Example GitHub Repo
This repository provides an example repository for you to base yours off of. If you start early with a repo, you can effectively track changes over the lifetime of a project. Here is a recommended structure, using Matlab as the language of choice, but all of this can be exapanded to any other text-focused project.

For a short powerpoint outlining parts of git and github, see [here](example.com).

## Quickstart
Most README files, especially for public projects, should start with the minimum steps to get started with a project. More details can be included in later sections, and people should be expected to read all of these, but a getting started never hurt anyone.
